# Carbon Copy

A fork of the EmulationStation theme "Carbon".

## Description

This is my customized fork of the [Fabrice CARUSO Carbon theme fork](https://github.com/fabricecaruso/es-theme-carbon).

Note that I:

* Use `US` as the theme region and don't fix/test other region settings.
* Only use ES for arcade, consoles and Steam - so changes for other system types, like computers, likely will not appear here.
* Will probably not keep this as updated as I'd like, or updated with the upstream repo, though I may PR some changes if they're appropriate.

## Notable Changes

The following are notable changes:

### Additional Platforms

The following platform art has been added:

* `megadrive-japan` - This is a commonly used "extra" platform to separate Japanese MD games
* `pspminis` - For PlayStation Minis, a.k.a. PSP Go digital games

### Updated Artwork

Filling in some blanks in the artwork and fixing some display issues, like the base Carbon theme (US region) displaying a TurboGrafx 16 console for the `pcengine` system, which it obviously isn't.
